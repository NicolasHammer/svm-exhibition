# SVM Exhibition
An exhibition of the Support Vector Machine model compared against its industry-level counterpart.  To illustrate the efficacy of the from-scratch SVM in a high dimensional setting, we examine the the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29) posted by the University of California Irvine.
